# General Requirements

* :books: Currently, we are interested in articles that revolve around internationalization/localization process (aka I18n and L10n). Ideally, these articles should be technical tutorials, but that's negotiable. If you have an interesting topic — don't hesitate to suggest it.
* :pencil: The article should be at the very least *1500* words long but no longer than *5000* words. 2200-2700 words is ideal.
* The article should cover a single topic with all the necessary explanations. The reader should be able to apply the received knowledge into practice. Do not write just for the sake of hitting a given character limit.
* If we don’t understand what we are writing about we will not be able to help others. If you find that you are writing about something that you don’t understand - either because there is jargon you don’t understand, or it’s a technical process like CI/CD that is new to you, or some other reason - you should educate yourself, reach out to experts and interview them to broaden your knowledge, and be accurate. It is better to push a deadline than to mislead/confuse our prospects and customers.
* The article should be clearly structured.
* :ballot_box_with_check: The article should be proofread before sending for review.
* The article should contain relevant code samples with all necessary explanations. If you demonstrate the concepts by building a sample application, its source code should be publicly available on GitHub, Bitbucket, CodePen, or a similar service. A working demo is appreciated as well.
* :copyright: The article is written exclusively for our blog. Reposts are not permitted without explicit approval from our side.
* The article should be written by you or your team — we take plagiarism very seriously.
