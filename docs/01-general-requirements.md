# General Requirements

* Currently, we are interested in articles that revolve around internationalization/localization process (aka I18n and L10n). Ideally, these articles should be technical tutorials, but that's negotiable. If you have an interesting topic â€” don't hesitate to suggest it.
* :pencil: The article should be at the very least *1500* characters long but no longer than *5000* characters. 2500-3000 characters is ideal.
* The article should cover a single topic with all the necessary explanations. The reader should be able to apply the received knowledge into practice. Do not write just for the sake of hitting a given character limit.
* The article should be clearly structured.
* :ballot_box_with_check: The article should be proofread before sending for review.
* The article should contain relevant code samples with all necessary explanations. If you demonstrate the concepts by building a sample application, its source code should be publicly available on GitHub, Bitbucket, CodePen, or a similar service. A working demo is appreciated as well.
* The article is written exclusively for our blog. Reposts are not permitted without explicit approval from our side.
* The article should be written by you or your team â€” we take plagiarism very seriously.
