## Creating a New Article

The articles are written in our WordPress CMS. You will be provided with all the necessary login information by your editor.

Next, give your post a title and proceed to writing. :star2:

**Note that the article has to be saved as a draft!**

## Markdown

If you prefer to write in Markdown format using your favourite editor — that's okay as well. Once your article is finished, log into our WordPress and import Markdown file using the Markdown plugin as [instructed in this small video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EhQ4Xjzg6s).

*Do not send plain Markdown files to your editor — import them into WordPress!*

## Readability

Our WordPress has a special plugin installed that will give you some tips regarding article readability. It can be found right under the text editor:
