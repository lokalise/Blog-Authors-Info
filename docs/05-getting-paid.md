# Getting Paid

The most pleasant part is getting paid for the hard work, right? So, here are some simple steps to complete in order to receive your :dollar::

* :ballot_box_with_check: Make sure your article is reviewed and there are no issues that require corrections from your side. Usually, the editor will approve the draft and notify you. Please, do not send invoices for unfinished articles.
* :hourglass_flowing_sand: Ideally, send an invoice right after your post is reviewed. We reserve a right not process invoices for the articles that were written more than 6 months ago.
* :scroll: Create a simple invoice which provides the following info:
  + Your name.
  + Your residence address.
  + Your e-mail.
  + Invoice number. Start with `1` and increment this number with each subsequent invoice.
  + "Billed to" â€” "Lokalise, Inc. EIN 61-1798824. 3500 South DuPont Highway, Suite BZ-101, Dover, DE 19901, USA".
  + Titles of the articles that you are invoicing for.
  + Price per each article.
  + Grand total.
  + :money_with_wings: Payment method. The preferred payment method is PayPal (don't forget to specify your PayPay e-mail). You may also request payment via SWIFT but this needs to be separately negotiated. Keep in mind that with SWIFT additional taxes may apply.
* :incoming_envelope: Send the invoice to invoices@lokalise.com.
* :moneybag: Wait for a couple of days (please note that we do not process invoices on weekends and public holidays) and check your account!
