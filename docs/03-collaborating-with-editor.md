# Collaborating With Your Editor

The *editor* is your friend and colleague. He will help you to write the best article in the world. However, the editor needs some help from your side as well. Keep in mind the following simple rules:

## Pitching and Outline

* :microphone: When pitching the article, clearly explain what it is going to cover (what language/technologies you are going to use and what skills the readers will gain).
* If you have multiple ideas in mind, pitch them separately.
* Provide a small outline of the article. Of course, this outline may be subject to some changes while you write.

## Asking Questions and Getting Help

Do not hesitate to ask the editor for help as he is here to assist you. However, please remember that the editor works with many authors while carrying out other tasks. Therefore, before asking for help do try to solve the problem by yourself.

## Deadlines

We are quite flexible with the deadlines, but once you have agreed a publication date, please try to prepare the text in time. If you have any problems and will not be able to finish the post in time, please notify the editor.

## Reviewing

After the article is finalized and proofread from your side, send it for review. The editor may request changes or provide some suggestions in order to ensure all articles meet a certain level of quality. The editor's job is not to mock or criticize you but to help you deliver quality content. If you do not agree with the editor, ask for clarifications and clearly state your point of view.
